      "fulltext": "It may sound fantastical Reader, but I am here to tell you about the very real floating whales of Patagonia. This decidedly non-fantastical phenomenon is thanks to the actions of a little studied species of cyanobacteria, Heliosum Leviosum, found in the lungs and digestive tract of certain, mysterious pelagic whale species which emits Helium as a waste product. Scientists are still at a loss as to the exact causes or mechanisms by which certain colonies of H. Leviosum grow so large in some whales as to render these particular individuals less dense than water, and sometimes, even air. These 'boisterously bouyant baleines', as French cetologist Yves Laurent likes to refer to them, have to date only been found floating in the stratosphere over Patagonia.
